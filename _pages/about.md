I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Physics Department at The Ohio State University. My research interests involve using the physics of the small to understand the physics of the big as a theorist; I like using math and observational data about subatomic particles from space to understand the physical processes behind stars, supernovae, dark matter, and other astronomical objects. I currently study topics in astroparticle physics theory with Professors John Beacom and Kaeli Hughes. I am broadly interested in theoretical astrophysics, especially multi-messenger efforts to study the high-energy universe.  Outside of research I am heavily involved in Polaris, a student-led partnership between graduate and undergraduate students in Physics and Astronomy at OSU dedicated to fostering a more welcoming and community oriented undergraduate physics experience in both Departments.

At OSU, I am a Graduate Research Fellow, holding a University Fellowship, a Patrick S. Osmer Fellowship, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

I’m originally from Hershey, Pennsylvania, but have spent a large part of my life in the Midwest. I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in 2022 with two Bachelor of Science Degrees in Physics as well as Astronomy & Astrophysics, along with a minor in Mathematics. I passed my Doctoral Candidacy Exam in the OSU Physics Department during summer of 2024 and obtained a Master of Science Degree in Physics.
